# Linkedlist Theory - Doubly LinkedList
## Problems with linkedList
  - We can go to back in a simple LinkedList
  - Solution: doubly linkedList -> node class two references, onde poinintg to the next node, one pointing to the previous node
  - Ok, we can get from everywhere to everywhere BUT it is not so memomry friendly, we have to store lots of references
  - BUT there is no need to track the previous node during traversal
