# LinkedList
  - LinkedLists are compose of nodes and references / pointers pointing from one node to the other
  - The last reference is pointing to a NULL

## A single node:
  - Contains data -> interger, double or custom object
  - Contains a reference poiting to the next node in the linkedlist
```sh
class Node{
    data
    Node nextNode
    ...
}
```
  - Each node is composed of a data ans a reference / link to the next node in the sequence
  - Simple and very common data structure
  - The can be used to implement several other commin data types: stacks, queues
  - Simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to he data // so we can not use indexes ... ```getItem(int index)```
  - Many basic operations such as obtaining the last node of the list or finding a node that contains a given data or locating the place where a new that contains a given data or lacting the place where a new node should be inserted - require sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements
## Advantages
  - LinkedLists are dynamic data structures (arrays are not)
  - It can allocate the needed memory in tun-time
  - Very efficient if we want to manipulate the first elements
  - EASY IMPLEMENTATION
  - Can store items with different sizes: an array assumes every element to be exactly the same
  - ItÂ´s easier for a linkedlist to grow organically. An array's size needs to be known ahead of time, or re-created when it needs to grow
## Disadvantages
  - Waste memory becaouse of th references
  - Nodes in a linkedlist must be read in order from the beginning as linkedlist sequencial access (array items can be reached via indexes in O(1) time)
  - Difficulties arise in linkedlist when it comes to reverse traversing. Singly linkedlists are extremely difficult to navigate backwars,
  - Solution: doubly linkedlist -> easier to read, but memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer
## Resume

|  | Linked List| Arrays|
| ------ | ------ |------|
| Search | O(N) | O(1) |
| Insert at the start | O(1) | O(N) |
| Insert at the end | O(N) | O(1) |
| Waste space | O(N) | 0 |
