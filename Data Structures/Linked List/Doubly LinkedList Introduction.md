# Doubly LinkedList Introduction
  - Doubly linkedList are composed of nodes and references / pointers pointing from one node to the other
  - The last and first references are pointing to a NULL
  - We can access the head
  - We can access the tail as well
# Advantages of double linkedList
  - A doubly linkedList can be traversal both directions: forward and backward
  - The remove operation is more efficient if the node is given
    - for linkedList we need the previous node as well. To find it usually we need to traverse the whole list
  - To remove a node from a singly linkedList -> we node the node + predecesssor
  - To remove a node from doubly linkeList -> we need the node
