# Binary Search Theory - Search, Insert

## Insertion
We start at the root node. 
If the data we want to insert is greater than the root node we go to the right, if it is smaller, we go to the left

```sh
binarySearhTree.insert(12)
```

## Search
We start at the root node. If the data we want to find is greater than the root node we go to the right, if it is smaller, we go to the left until we find it !!!

```sh
binarySearhTree.find(5)
```
